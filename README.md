This repository houses scripts for populations genomics. The scripts were initially written for a population genomics study of the freshwater snail <i>Leptoxis ampla</i>

Most of these scripts are straightforward and they are designed to work with the data generated for the L. ampla study. Given the limited scope of these scripts, they are not designed to be widely applicable to many different studies and/or file formats like scripts in some of my other repositories.
