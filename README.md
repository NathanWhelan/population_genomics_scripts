This repository houses scripts for populations genomics. The scripts were initially written for a population genomics study of the freshwater snail <i>Leptoxis ampla</i>, and there is a branch for scripts used for a study on <i>Leptoxis compacta</i>. 

Most of these scripts are straightforward and they are designed to work with the data generated for studies in my lab. Given the limited scope of these scripts, they are not designed to be widely applicable to many different studies and/or file formats like scripts in some of my other repositories. 

However, they may be useful if you're interested in SNP based conservation genomics analyses. Almost all input files can be generated with Stacks, except hierfstat input for calculating pairwise Fst. That was generated with PGDSpider using the genepop file output by the populations module in stacks.
